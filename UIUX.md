1. Simplicity
For simplicity, we kept all of the interfaces simple and easy to use with minimal distractions and clear navigation. For example, we only provided the user with the information that they needed to complete the action. Within the ManageGamePage, we provided the total number of questions, the current question that the quiz is on, and two buttons that advance the quiz and end the quiz.
We believed that this is the only functionality that we needed for this page, and we limited any other unnecessary noise to make the website simple to use.

2. Consistency
For consistency, we kept the design elements and layout consistent throughout BigBrain. For example, all of our "positive" buttons, such as Update, Add, Start, etc. were all blue in colour. On top of this, all of our "negative" buttons, such as Delete, Back, Close, etc. were outlined in blue and transparent inside. This consistency makes it easy for our users to understand how to make their way around BigBrain. This also provided visual hierarchy, where the important things, such as Start Quiz would stand out.

3. User Centered Design
For UCD, we ensured that BigBrain was mapped out in a way where the most important preference of the user is considered. Because of this, we made it so you can update the quiz name and structure, which we thought would be the most important factor, then the questions separated into a different page, where, if not necessary, the user wouldn't have to worry about.
